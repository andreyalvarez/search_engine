# search_engine
Search engine that searches in a JSON file any matches.

This Search Engine searches matches from a text field into a JSON file. It's not case sensitvie so it allows you to find the matches without having to worry if the search field is lower / capital case. 

Also, you can hit submit without filling anythin in the search box and it will return the full content of the JSON file. 

Lastly if no results are found, it will show you a small message letting you know that no results were found.

Carlos
