# search_engine
Search engine that searches in a JSON file any matches.

This Search Engine searches matches from a JSON file. The matches are return in a JSON and displayed the same page. It's not case sensitvie so it allows you to find the matches without having to worry if the search field is lower / capital case. 

Also, you can hit submit without filling anythin in the search box and it will return the full content of the JSON file. 

Lastly if no results are found, it will show you a small message letting you know that no results were found. 

You can see a live version in the following link: http://18.219.213.44/search_engine/  

This live version is hosted in a AWS EC2 instance server. It's running in a Ubuntu LAPM server set up.
